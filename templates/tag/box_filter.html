For each pair of photos below, you'll see boxes that other Turkers have drawn. Your job is to <b>select the boxes that best divide the foods on the plate.</b>
<br/><br />It's okay if some boxes contain one food made of many <i>parts</i>, like a salad with lettuce and dressing or a sandwich with bread, cheese, and meat. But, one box should never contain two <i>completely distinct</i> foods, like a piece of chicken and an apple.
Please do not select a photo if it has a box that does not contain food. If all the photos have boxes without food, please skip this task.
<br/><br/>Select the best group of boxes for each pair by clicking on it. The background will turn green.
