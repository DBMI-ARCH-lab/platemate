Below, you will see a picture of a meal and a list of ingredients.
<br /><br />
The ingredients are a result of multiple Turkers attempting to identify foods in different parts of the meal.
This process often results in ingredients that are very similar to each other being specified by different Turkers.
<br /><br />
We call these very similar ingredients "duplicates". Your goal is to <b>remove any duplicates and leave
only the ingredients that best describe the meal</b>.
<br /><br />
You can remove an ingredient by un-checking the box next to it.
<br /><br />
For example, if the list contained both "Cooked Carrots" and "Carrots", you might un-check "Carrots" and
leave "Cooked Carrots" checked.
