\abstract We introduce PlateMate, a system that allows users to take photos of their meals and
receive estimates of food intake and composition. Accurate awareness
of this information can help people monitor their progress towards  
 dieting goals, but current
methods for food logging via self-reporting, expert observation, or
algorithmic analysis are time-consuming, expensive, or inaccurate.
PlateMate crowdsources nutritional analysis from photographs using
Amazon Mechanical Turk, automatically coordinating untrained workers
to estimate a meal's calories, fat, carbohydrates, and protein.  We
present the Management framework for crowdsourcing complex tasks,
which supports PlateMate's nutrition analysis workflow. Results of our evaluations
show that PlateMate is nearly as accurate as a trained
dietitian and easier to use for most users than traditional
self-reporting.
